###The Surveyor:

A surveyor is given a contract to survey land for construction. The construction is planned in such a way that it should be in a regular shape. Given the angle between two sides of a construction shape X degrees, the surveyor needs to find weather he can survey a regular shaped land with the internal angle between it's sides is X. As the surveyor have heavy work load, your job is to code a simple program to help the surveyor, that prints YES if the construction is possible and NO if it's not.

INPUT:
1st line contains the number of test cases T,
next T lines contain the value x,internal angle between the construction shapes.

OUTPUT:
T lines, each line printing YES if construction is possible and NO if not.

CONSTRAINTS:
0 <= T <= 10^3
0 <= X <= 10^9

Time Limt: 0.01 sec

Sample test case:
1)INPUT:
	2
	60
	70
  OUTPUT:
	YES
	NO

Explaination:
given T=2 and
for first test case X = 60 degrees,possible for a construction with 3 sides(triangle).
