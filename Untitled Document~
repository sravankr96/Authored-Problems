Playing with strings

Hasmukh always likes string computations and also he is good at it. One of his friends came to him with one such problem. That is given a string S he rotates it in both the directions specified number of times left rotations given by KL and right rotations given by KR.
The rotations are defined as,
1.Each left rotation diaplaces all the charecters backward by one position and the first element goes to te last position.
2.Each right rotation displaces all the charecters forward by one position and the last element comes to the first position.

Once the rotations are done he gives Q number of queries. For each query q hasmukh should answer the charecter at that position after the rotations.
This operation 'll be performed T times by providing a new set of input string,rotations and queries at each test case.

INPUT format:
First line consists of T testcases.
for each T testcase S,KL,KR,Q are provided.
The next Q lines contain a Query q in each.

OUTPUT format:
Output contains q lines each displaying the charecter at the queried position.

constraints:
0 <= T <= 10^5
0 < S[] <= 10^5
0 <= KL,KR <= 10^9
0 <= Q <= 10^9
0 <= q < s[]

(s[] ->size of the input string
 consider 0 as the starting position of the string)

Sample INPUT1:
1
abcdefghi 4 2 4
2
4
6
8

Sample OUTPUT1:
e
g
i
b

Explaination:
Input string:	abcdefghi
string after rotations:	cdefghiab
e,g,i,b are the chars at the queried positions 2,4,6,8 respectively.
